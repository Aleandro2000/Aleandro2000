### Hi there, I'm Alexandru Carmici - aka [Aleandro2000][website] ðŸ‘‹
## I'm ACS Student and Web Application Developer!!

Personal and Professional development is one of my main interests and that is why I have been looking to develop my skills and knowledge through many paths. Being a System Engineering Student at the University Politehnica of Bucharest and working as a web application developer at GDM Webmedia, I gathered experience with technologies such as ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, NestJS, Databases, Microservices (such as Docker), bash scripting, Strapi and Cypress.

Besides being passionate about programming and pursuing to evolve in this matter, I have also been busy with involving in LSAC IT projects. I am hardworking, passionate, and committed to my work, while also being up for new challenges and opportunities.
